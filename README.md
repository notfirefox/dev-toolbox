# Development Container
Development Container using Distrobox

## :warning: State of Toolbx
Toolbx is, as of now, not suited for this workflow because it has some issues 
including, but not limited to:

- [gh auth login does not work inside of dev container](https://github.com/notfirefox/dev-container/issues/1)
- [Environment variables from .zshenv are not present](https://github.com/notfirefox/dev-container/issues/4)

## Installation
Run the setup script.
```sh
./setup-toolbx
```
